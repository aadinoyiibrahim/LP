# tutorial on `Best Open‑Source Linear Programming Solver`

To replicate the code, goto `1\README.md` to see steps on how to run the code. 

This tutorial tests a few open-source solvers for linear programming in Python.

Based on the experiment conducted, we recommend to use:

- CLP, if you want plug-and-play reliability
- GLPK, if your models are large and you can ensure numerical stability.
- HiGHS, if you plan to customize settings or need modern APIs.


# tutorial on `Capacitated Facility-Location MIP with Open-Source Solvers`

To replicate the code, goto `2\README.md` to see steps on how to run the code. 

This tutorial will test a few open-source solvers on a realistic Mixed-Integer Programming problem: the capacitated facility-location and distribution network.

GLPK achieves the fastest solve time and lowest memory usage while matching CBC and SCIP in objective solution, optimal status, and zero gap, making it the most efficient choice for the instance considered here.
